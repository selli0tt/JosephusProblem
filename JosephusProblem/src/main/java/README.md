The Josephus Problem is a fascinating ancient math problem rooted in history. During a Jewish revolt against Rome, 40 soldiers were held up in a cave. Rather than surrender and be captured by the Romans, they devised a plan to kill themselves. This plan involved the soldiers arranging themselves in a circle and one by one they would eliminate every other soldier until one remained. This remaining soldier would then be responsible for taking their own life. One of the soldiers, a man by the name of Flavius Josephus, silently decided against the idea and would rather surrender than die.

Given a set number of people standing in a circle, what position should you be in if you want to be the last one standing? The elimination order is the same as described above.
